"The year is 1492 DR, the Year of Three Ships Sailing. A very harsh winter has given way to a more forgiving spring.  The air cold and damp, Waterdeep is becoming more lively as Waterdavian's emerge from their homes.  Walking through the cold misty air, reflecting on the turning of seasons, you realize how much more violent the city was than other winter's past where usually, Waterdeep comes to a crawl.. Maybe it was just the wicked temperatures getting the best of the people.  As you enter the Yawning Portal, Waterdeep's most lively and bustling inn located in the Castle Ward, you are greeted with the noises of lively patrons, crackling wood from the multiple fireplaces' and an overwhelming sense of relief from the cold misty air."

    > My friend’s name is Floon Blagmaar. He’s got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped — or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?”

    > In a scratchy voice: “No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss.”
